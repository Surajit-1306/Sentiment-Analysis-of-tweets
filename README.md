# Sentiment-Analysis-of-tweets
Sentiment analysis of tweets using a machine learning approach involves classifying tweets into two distinct classes: positive and negative. This task requires training a model on a labeled dataset of tweets, where each tweet is annotated as either positive or negative. The machine learning model learns patterns and features from this training data to make predictions on unseen tweets. The model utilizes various natural language processing techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and feature extraction, to convert the textual data into numerical representations. It then employs algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machines, or deep learning models to classify the tweets into positive or negative sentiment categories. The performance of the sentiment analysis model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to determine its effectiveness in accurately identifying the sentiment of tweets.
